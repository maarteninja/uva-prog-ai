# Homework Week 2

The homework for this week consists of the following chapters from *Think
Java*. You are required to mark all sections that you find hard to
understand. You must also write down any questions that pop-up during reading.

* Chapter 4
* Chapter 6.1 -- 6.5
* Chapter 7
* Chapter 9

You must bring the syllabus with your notes to the first lab session. We will
check what you've read and will talk about the questions you have.

You are strongly encourage to read these chapters again during the week, because
these may not make sense immediately without practice.
