# Homework Week 1

The homework for this week consists of the following lectures, chapters from
*Karel the Robot*, and chapters from *Think Java*. What you should do:

* You are required to mark all sections that you find hard to understand.

* You must write down, in your book or separately, any questions that pop up during reading.

* You must bring your book with you, including notes, to all lab sessions.

## Before the first lab session

* Lecture 1 and 2.
* Chapters 1 -- 3 from *Karel the Robot*.
* Chapter 1 from *Think Java*.

## Before the second lab session

* Lecture 3.
* Chapters 4 and 5 from *Karel the Robot*.

## Before the third lab session

* Lecture 4.

You must bring the syllabus with your notes to each lab session. We will check
what you've read and will talk about the questions you have.

You are strongly encourage to the chapters again during the week, because these
may not make sense immediately without practice.
