# Homework Week 1

The homework for this week consists of the following lectures, chapters from
*Karel the Robot*, and chapters from *Think Java*. You are required to mark all
sections that you find hard to understand. You must also write down any
questions that pop-up during reading.

## Before the first lab session

* Lecture 1 and 2.
* Chapters 1 -- 3 from *Karel the Robot*.
* Chapter 1 from *Think Java*.

## Before the second lab session

* Lecture 3.
* Chapters 4 and 5 from *Karel the Robot*.

## Before the third lab session

* Lecture 4.

You must bring the syllabus with your notes to each lab session. We will check
what you've read and will talk about the questions you have.

You are strongly encourage to the chapters again during the week, because these
may not make sense immediately without practice.
