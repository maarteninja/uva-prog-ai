# Problem Set 3: Hangman

This is a large assignment, but well within your capabilities, as long as you
break the problem up into manageable pieces. The decomposition is discussed in
this handout, and there are several suggestions for staying on top of things in
the "Strategy and tactics" section.

## Objectives

- Working with Strings
- Reading files in Java
- Using an ArrayList
- Working with multiple Java files in a single program

## Recommended Reading

Review these chapters if needed; they cover important concepts from last week. If you skim them a little, you may be able to use them as a good reference when writing your programs! However, before anything else, best to watch this week's lectures!

## Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope
: To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

Correctness
: To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design
: To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style
: To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

All students must ordinarily submit this and all other problem sets to be
eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the
course's heads.
