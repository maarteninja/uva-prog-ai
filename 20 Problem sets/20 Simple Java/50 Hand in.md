# Handing in your work

Below are the instructions to hand in your work.

## Adding comments

The problems in this problem set do not usually require a lot of
comments. We would like to see, however, atop each function, a short description
of what it does.

	// this is a comment that describes the line(s) below

And finally, make very sure that your files include a short top comment
describing what the program does, and your name!

## Submitting your work

* You can make a zip with the required files by running the following command
  in a terminal.

        make submit

  Make sure to run this in **both** *pset1* and *pset2* folders. You can submit 
  the zip files at the bottom of this page.
    
* You can submit a problem set multiple times, we always grade at the last
  submission before the deadline. Make sure to submit all files when you
  resubmit, not only the files that changed.
  
* After the weekend, you'll see if you got a grade or if your submission was
  rejected. In all cases, ask your assistant for feedback on the problem set 
  during the lab sessions. This is how you learn!
