## Hacker edition (optional) `MazeSolvingKarel.java`

Looking for a challenge? Then try and make Karel solve mazes! There are 5 mazes 
included in the Karel files (*pset1.zip*). The first two mazes can be solved by
following simple rules, the remaining three however are more difficult.

A maze in the world of Karel looks like this:

![A maze in the world of Karel.](figure8.png)

The exits of a maze are marked by a beeper. You can assume these are the only
beepers in the world. Placing extra beepers is allowed, but take care not to
confuse these with the real exits!

The files include five mazes, numbered 1 through 5. Your solution should be a
single class, `MazeSolvingKarel`, which can move Karel to the exit of as many 
mazes as you can solve.

Be sure to include in the comments which mazes you solved and what algorithm 
you used to solve them. Add a short summary and insert comments in the code 
that describe your approach.

Want some ideas to solve the harder mazes? Try

`SuperKarel` is capable of painting floors. This can help keep track of where
you've been.

# Handing in your work

Below are the instructions to hand in your work.

## Adding comments

The problems in this problem set do not usually require a lot of
comments. We would like to see, however, atop each function, a short description
of what it does.

	// this is a comment that describes the line(s) below

And finally, make very sure that your files include a short top comment
describing what the program does, and your name!

	 * Lets Karel walk some steps.
	 */

## Submitting your work

* You can make a zip with the required files by running the following command
  in a terminal.

        make submit

  Make sure to run this in **both** *pset1* and *pset2* folders. You can submit 
  the zip files at the bottom of this page.
    
* You can submit a problem set multiple times, we always grade at the last
  submission before the deadline. Make sure to submit all files when you
  resubmit, not only the files that changed.
  
* After the weekend, you'll see if you got a grade or if your submission was
  rejected. In all cases, ask your assistant for feedback on the problem set 
  during the lab sessions. This is how you learn!
